# Documentation

First of all, all my test ran at a lab platformâ€¦ Use following code at your own risk, I won't be responsible for any issues you may run into. Thanks!

In this repository I created a automated Horizon Whitelist Firewall Ruleset, which can be used with
Terraform and VMC on AWS.

It only apply Horizon related Services, groups and Distributed Firewall Sections and Rules.

This code should support you to build a whitelist Firewall Horizon Plattform or get a idea how you can secure your Horizon Environment.

To get familiar with VMC and VMC NSX-T I highly recommend to take a look on the Blog posts from Nicolas Vibert:
https://nicovibert.com

I will keep on working on this script and add new services, rules and groups.
