# Terraform automated whitelist firewall ruleset for Horizon and VMC on AWS

This is the repository for the automated Horizon Whitelist Firewall Ruleset, which can be used with
Terraform.

In this script I using VMC on AWS and the Terraform Provider for NSX-T.

# Terraform NSX-T Provider
The newest version from Terraform NSX-T Provider can always be found here: https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-nsxt/

Currently the NSX-T Provider for VMC on AWS is not official supported.

For general information about Terraform, visit the [official
website][tf-website] and the [GitHub project page][tf-github].
